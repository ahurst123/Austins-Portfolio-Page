                <p>Ever since I was a young kid I loved computers, specifically playing games on computers.
                    In 2018 I took my first coding class, and since then I have learned a couple of different languages
                    such as Java, and Lua. I am currently going for my certificate in coding, and currently learning
                    JavaScript and HTML5.
