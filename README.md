# Austins-Portfolio-Page
This is going to be my landing page for my own website
You can expect my newest projects to show up here and other coding work
There is a bunch of functionality on this website such as:
Sticky nav bar with buttons that actually work
ways to contact me
ai generated photos of my future coding projects
a sticky footer describing myself
a page about me and my coding past
a clickable image to my last project
flexbox stuff, it is super cool but i dont fully get it yet
overall I have learned a lot from this project.
